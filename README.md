Welcome in the README file :)
Write here a few introduction words for your project. 

If you want inspiration on how to write an awesome README, check this github repo : https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/awesome-readme . But don't spend to much time on it. This is not the topic of this course.

If you need help with the Markdown syntax, you might find some help here : https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/ .

Good luck with your project. 
May the force be with you.
